THINGS TO CHECK
----------------

typo: errorMessage

invalid commands: should return {response: error, errorMessage: invalid command}

*some extra messages appear after "response: success" (see test results)


PUBLISH COMMAND:
----------------
publishing a resource with same primary key should overwrite (but it responds with error)

there is 'errorMessage...' after 'response: success'

should not be able to publish a file scheme uri (need to return 'missing resource')


REMOVE COMMAND:
---------------
able to remove resource from given channel without giving owner (should be wrong primary key)

resource field not correct type should give {response: error, errorMessage: missing resource}


SHARE COMMAND:
--------------
secret/uri not given should give "errorMessage: missing resource and/or secret" (it gives ERROR: require secret/require uri)

cannot successfully share??


incorrect secret should give response "errorMessage: incorrect secret" (it gives ERROR: require secret)


QUERY COMMAND:
--------------
errorMessage info also returned with resource

cannot do owner search (from assignment sheet: if the template contains owner that is not "", candidate must equal.... -means we should be able to do owner search?)

not all name-search results returned

some non-matching description-search results returned

the command sometimes behaves strangely...

search for two conditions not returning results


FETCH COMMAND:
---------------
*tested by Alston

should I be able to see physical image?

uri not given - should return "errorMessage: missing resourceTemplate" (it returns ERROR: require uri)


EXCHANGE COMMAND:
-----------------
server was invalid or missing - how to test this

cannot query other server after server exchange?
